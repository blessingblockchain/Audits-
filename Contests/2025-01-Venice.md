## [H-01] Risk of first depositor inflation attack in `staking.sol`
### Description


## Root cause
 from the starting mechanism where the first staker can set the `totalSupply` to a very small number, this  leads to a disproportionately high accRewardPerShare when rewards are calculated. This happens because:

* When the first stake occurs, totalSupply is zero. 
* The stake function mints tokens equal to the stake amount, setting totalSupply to this small value.
* accRewardPerShare is updated by dividing new rewards by totalSupply, which is small, resulting to a large increase in accRewardPerShare.

## Impact
  
 * The first staker can claim a significant portion of all future rewards with a minimal initial investment.

* Subsequent stakers receive fewer rewards than they should, diminishing the appeal of participating in the staking pool.

### POC: This is a direct risk.

* Alice stakes 1 wei when totalSupply is 0. This sets totalSupply to 1 wei.

* Enough time passes for rewards to accumulate. Let's say 10,000 new reward tokens (stakerPortion) are minted.

* accRewardPerShare increases by (10,000 * 1e18) / 1, making it significantly high due to the tiny totalSupply.

* Bob(second staker)  stakes 1 ETH after Alice. Despite his large stake, because accRewardPerShare is already high, his impact on it is minimal.

* Alice, with just 1 wei staked, claims rewards based on this high accRewardPerShare, receiving a disproportionate amount of rewards.

*Bob's rewards are much less impactful due to the existing high accRewardPerShare.

## Mitigation:

Mint a small, predefined amount of staking tokens to a neutral address or the contract itself at initialization. This ensures totalSupply is never zero, preventing the first staker from having an undue advantage.

## [M-01] Risk of Unfair Reward Timing.
### Description

M-01. Risk of Unfair Reward Timing

## Root Cause:


The `accRewardPerShare` variable accumulates rewards for all stakers and updates globally when the `_harvest` function can be called by any user.

 But since `accRewardPerShare` is updated for all users during a claim, it creates a scenario where rewards calculated at the time of staking or claiming can disproportionately benefit users who time their actions effectively.

How is this possible? 

 The use of a single `accRewardPerShare` for all stakers allows users to take advantage of rewards accumulated before their contribution.

without restrictions on when claims can be made, a user would manipulate the system by staking right before and claiming right after another user's claim, capturing a share of the rewards without proportional contribution.

 ### PoC

At initial State accRewardPerShareis  100.
No claims have been made for a week, causing rewards to accumulate.

Alice Stakes:
Attacker stakes 10 tokens just before Bob decides to claim his accumulated rewards(he monitors bob through the mempool)

Bob Claims:- original user. 
Bob calls `claimRewards()`, which updates `accRewardPerShar`e to 200 based on a week’s worth of accumulated rewards.
Bob's rewards are calculated with the new `accRewardPerShare`, and his rewardDebt is updated.

Alice (attacker) claims:
Alice calls `claimRewards()` immediately after Bob’s claim.

Her rewards are calculated with the updated `accRewardPerShare = 200`. Since Alice’s `rewardDebt` is based on her staking time (or is zero for her first claim), she benefits from the high `accRewardPerShare` without having contributed to the period during which these rewards were earned.

## mitigation
* Implement a minimum claim interval (MIN_CLAIM_INTERVAL) to limit how frequently users can claim rewards.

Add a mapping to track lastClaimTime for each user.
Introduce a time-based restriction in the _harvest function to ensure users cannot claim rewards too frequently.

The `MIN_CLAIM_INTERVAL` enforces a time gap between consecutive claims by a user, reducing the possibility of users immediately reacting to others’ claims to exploit updated rewards.
